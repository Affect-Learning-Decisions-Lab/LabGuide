# Lab Guide

This is a general guide about the lab value, culture and expectations that we can upadate and modify regularly.

## Values and culture

- **Excellence:** We aim at scientific excellence, regardless the specific research question we are trying to answer, we strive to maintain the highest level of scientific integrity, and continuously develop and learn new techniques and theories. 

- **Open and collaborative practice:** We aim at a science that is open and collaborative, we spend a significant amount of time making our dataset and code available to the scientific community.

- **Inclusivity:** We aim at fostering a team that is inclusive and to investigate mechanisms on inclusive and diverse samples and to promote inclusive communication. The lab should be a safe space in which every member belongs and thrives.

- **Interdisciplinary:**  we belive that in the investigation of psychological constructs such as affect, learning and mental health, interdisciplinarity is key. Interdisciplinarity allows to define and understand the objects of ours studies and to understand the implications that these can have on societies. 

- **Work-life balance:** We aim at promoting an healthy work-life balance. Our work hours are flexible, while taking appropriate breaks. We do not work when we are sick. We all have a life beyond the lab, which we should value and intentionally take time for, whether itâ€™s hobbies, friends, family, sports, traveling or just alone time.
